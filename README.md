# CentipedeGame
A recreation of the classic Centipede game in C++

This code is not meant to run. It is part of my portfolio to showcase what I have done with C++.

For this project, our instructor handed us an empty, barebones engine and the sprites used. Nothing else. Over the course of the class, we were to code -everything- within the game. Enemies, the player, high score tracking, managing the waves, the title screen and the AI that was used during it, and many other things.

I have not included the engine or any code I did not write. Everything within this project are things that I myself have written.

Code was written in the Fall of 2019.
